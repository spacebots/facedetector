I) Pre-requisites
1) Opencv (http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/)

II) Running the program
1) run make in the directory, may have to adapt directory paths inside FaceDetect.cpp
(constructor) and Makefile to use your own paths.

2) run ./FaceDetect to start the program

III) Functionality and features

1) Reduce false detection by determining largest probable face in an image 
cutting the ROI (probable face in the image) then again perform face detection on sub image.
see FaceDetect.pdf for simple illustration.

2) Calculate approximate angles from camera focal point to detected face (X,Y degrees)

3) Calculate the approximate distance of face from camera using difference between
Face bounding Box and image size. Currently works with 640 * 480 
resolution with a threshold value of 297000 to detect face in range of 80cm to 100cm.

4) Please note that this face detection implementation detects only one face at a time,
in case of multiple users it will detect the largest/closest face to the camera.

In case of questions please ask Amol Deshmukh a.deshmukh@hw.ac.uk
